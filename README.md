A knowledge repository that analyzes and documents the architecture of well-known open source software using AI.

## Purpose

This project was created as a starting point for personal learning — a way to spark curiosity about how real-world open source software is designed and built.

- Provide a lightweight entry point for studying the architecture of notable OSS projects
- Dig into the "why" behind design decisions and extract insights applicable to your own projects
- Encourage deeper exploration by summarizing key design patterns, trade-offs, and takeaways
- Manage reports in a reproducible format, designed for AI (LLM) generation

## Reports

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for a guided learning path organized by difficulty level and theme.

See [TABLE.md](TABLE.md) for the full list of analyzed projects.

See [COMPARISONS.md](COMPARISONS.md) for architecture comparisons between similar projects.

## Report Format

Each report consists of a single file at `oss/{project-name}/README.md` and includes the following sections:

1. Metadata — Repository URL, license, commit/version at time of analysis, generation model
2. Overview — Project purpose, problems it solves, positioning
3. Architecture Overview — High-level description with Mermaid diagrams
4. Core Components — Responsibilities and design patterns of key modules
5. Data Flow — Sequence diagrams of representative use cases
6. Key Design Decisions — Choices, rationale, and trade-offs
7. Dependencies — Dependency graphs for external libraries and related projects
8. Testing Strategy — Testing approach
9. Key Takeaways — Design insights applicable to other projects
10. References — Official documentation and related resources

## Contributing

Want a report for an OSS project that isn't covered yet? Just open an Issue with the project name as the title — no description needed. I'll generate and publish the report shortly.

Example: `Request: Caddy`

## Disclaimer

- All reports are generated by AI (LLM)
- Each report's metadata specifies the model used and the generation date
- Accuracy is based on the source code and documentation at the time of analysis, but may contain errors
- Corrections and improvements via Issues or PRs are welcome
